<h1>One Pager</h1>

<h2>Short Pitch</h2>
<p>nickbunton.com will be a website that shares up and coming media such as TV shows, apps, music, and more.</p>

<h2>Long Pitch</h2>
<p> nickbunton.com will be a website that shares up and coming media (based on my opinion) such as TV shows, apps, music, and more. Ideally, the site will connect with other apps such as Spotify, IMDB, and the App Store to have the user be able to access or download the media. There will also be options to share the media to to social sites.</p>
<h2>Personas</h2>
