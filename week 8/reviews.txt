Reviews for Wireframing Tools

1. Mockingbird - I like this one a lot. It has a very good UI and I like that you are to click and drag
                elements into your wireframe. I will probably end up using this one for the project.    Having the widget bar right next to your project make it very easy to decide if you like
                your new change. If you don't it's very to easy to remove that change, or do something different with it. (Edit: turns out not truly free so I'm not going to use it.. Good tool though)

2.   Framebox - These is also a nice tool with a good UI. It is free so I'll end up using this one.
                doesn't look as nice as Mockingbird, but the reason I'll use it is it is free.
                I like how it has a big space to put in your design and can easily add new parts to it without any difficulty.
